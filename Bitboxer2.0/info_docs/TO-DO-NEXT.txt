===============================
TO-DO next; food for thought:


• We need more UI elements to make the import options more clear. 

• The ideal interface would display a musical keyboard as an SVG image, with highlighted key ranges showing which sample is assigned to each range. This tab should allow manipulation of individual samples within the multi-sample set, such as changing loop points for each sample. The loop point information is stored within the chunk metadata of the wave files, and this is also the data that the Bitbox hardware reads for looping multi-samples.

• The maximum range for the sample start, sample end, loop start, and loop end sliders should be dynamically determined based on the total number of samples in the loaded audio file. Currently, using a fixed 4GB maximum range makes the sliders too coarse, causing even tiny movements to jump large distances. Instead, when a sample is loaded, the maximum slider value should be set to the sample’s actual length in samples.
slider_max_value = audio_sample.length_in_samples

• Current behavior:
- Importing a preset.xml resets every pad in the project.

Desired behavior for the merge function:
1. The system should first determine how many pads are currently in use in the project.  
2. Then, it should check how many pads exist in the preset.xml file being imported.  
3. If the preset contains more pads than there are empty pads available in the project, the user should be prompted with options to:
   - Select which pads to import,
   - Leave certain pads out, or
   - Overwrite existing pads.
This ensures flexibility and prevents unwanted loss of data when merging presets into an active project.

• think about how to split up sfz files with more layers playing at once. (eg. the Roland JV patches with multiple layers)
• think about a way to use sfz files with velocity layers.
