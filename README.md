TO-DO:
		
02-**New feature** Merge presets: When user has a preset open, and clicks merge preset; the following should happen: See what and how many Pads are unused. See how many pads are inside the file just selected to be merged with the one already in memory. If in-memory-pads + to-be-merged-pads > 16pads then ask the user, what pads should be imported from to-be-merged-preset; and checked on a checklist in a message window.


**If you make any code changes, please __only__ send the JavaScript-function or part of the code that was changed. __Do not__ send the whole code, as that is way too expensive (token wise).**

==========================================================

Just some findings:

```
MODULATION:

No Modulation = omit the <modsource/> on that slot

Modulation Sources:
src = "mod1"     
src = "mod2"     
src = "mod3"     
src = "mod4"     
src = "mod5"     
src = "mod6"     
src = "mod7"     
src = "mod8"     
src = "keytrig"  
src = "velocity" 
src = "lfo1"     
src = "pitchbend"
src = "modwheel"
src = "midivol" 
src = "midipan" 
src = "midicc"
