// 20 Velocity Layer Test SFZ
// All regions cover C3-C4 with different velocity ranges

// What to Expect:
// • Console should show: "⚠️ 20 zones → 16"
// • Modal should show: "Layer 1: Keys C3-C4 ⚠️ 20 zones → 16"
// • After import: Pad should have 16 velocity zones (merged from 20)
// • Console should log: Bin mappings showing which samples were merged

// What actually happend:
// • Console did show: "⚠️ 20 zones → 16", but it is not what it did.
//     • 1st try: It actually merged 20 zones → 10, the rest is not in the multi.
//     • 2nd try (on same pad, no refresh or 'new preset'): 
//     It added another 10 zones to the previous 10, so now there are 20 zones in the pad. 
//     There was no modal whatsoever asking. 
//     **!!! But I guess that the pad was not initialised before import sfz was triggered!!!**
// • Modal should show: "Layer 1: Keys C3-C4 ⚠️ 20 zones → 16" - There was no modal at all.
// • After import: Pad should have 16 velocity zones (merged from 20) - No, it was 10.
// • Console should log: Bin mappings showing which samples were merged - Only 10 bins are in console.
