// Single layer with key-mapped regions (like trumpet)
// Should load to 1 pad as multisample

// Expected:
// ✅ Single layer detected (no overlap)
// ✅ No modal shown
// ✅ Loads to 1 pad with 6 key zones

// Actual:
// ✅ Single layer detected (no overlap)
// ✅ No modal shown
// ✅ Loads to 1 pad with 6 key zones
