// Three layers with partial key overlap
// Layer 1: C2-C4, Layer 2: C3-C5, Layer 3: C4-C6

// Expected:
// ✅ 3 layers detected (partial overlap counts as overlap)
// ✅ Modal shows 3 layers with different key ranges
// ✅ Loads to 3 pads

// I have experimented with this and it seems that **only** <group> is used to separate the layers, 
// and overlapping keys are not catched (used) for separation.
// When I remove the <group> headers and all will get only one pad, 
// that pad will **not** play on hardware because of conflicting note ranges.

<group> // Layer 1: Low
